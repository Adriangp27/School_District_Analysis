Below is a list of deliverables according to the requirements of the school board.

A. Removing prefixes and suffixes from student names in the dataset

B. Remove NAN (Not a Number) from Thomas High School's 9th Grade students' math and readinng grades.

C. Create a complete student dataframe by merging school and student data
